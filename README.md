# 🩸 Smart Blood Donor Finder System

A Python-based web application developed as the **main project for the Python module** in my **PG Diploma in ROS 2** from **iHub School of Learning**.

The project focuses on creating a **socially relevant, privacy-aware blood donor management system** where donors are verified by an admin before being made visible to patients or hospitals.

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Smart Blood Donor Finder System** allows donors to register their details along with a medical certificate.

This project evolved based on **Stage-1 review feedback**, where mentors advised enhancing real-world usability, validation, and access control.
